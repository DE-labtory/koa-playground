### Commit Message Guidelines

We have rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the change log. We follow [conventional commits](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).



#### Commit Message Structure

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Samples
